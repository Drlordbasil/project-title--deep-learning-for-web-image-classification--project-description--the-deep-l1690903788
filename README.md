# Deep Learning for Web Image Classification

The Deep Learning for Web Image Classification project aims to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images extracted from the web. The program uses Python with libraries such as Beautiful Soup and TensorFlow to scrape and process images, as well as train and evaluate the deep learning model.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping**: The program utilizes Beautiful Soup to scrape web pages for images related to a specific topic or category. It can search for images based on keywords or scrape specific websites.

2. **Image Processing and Augmentation**: The program preprocesses the scraped images using the OpenCV library. It resizes, normalizes, and augments the images to improve training data quality and performance.

3. **Model Training**: The program uses TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library, to construct and train a CNN model. The scraped images are split into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model's performance. Transfer learning using pre-trained models such as VGG, Inception, or ResNet can also be explored.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The program assesses the trained model's performance by evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the validation set. It generates a detailed report indicating the model's classification performance.

5. **Web-based Image Classification**: The trained model is utilized to classify new images obtained from the web. The program fetches images based on user input and uses the trained model to predict their categories. This allows users to classify images without needing to download or store them locally.

6. **User Interface**: The program can be enhanced with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using libraries such as Tkinter or Flask. The GUI provides options to configure scraping parameters, view classification results, and explore images fetched from the web.

## Benefits

1. **Automation**: The project automates the image scraping process, eliminating the need for manual downloading and organizing files.

2. **Extensibility**: By using deep learning techniques, the model can be trained on diverse categories to classify a broad range of web images.

3. **Accessibility**: The program allows users to classify web images without the burden of saving them locally, making it accessible for users with limited storage resources.

4. **Learning Opportunity**: The project offers an opportunity to understand and implement web scraping, image processing, deep learning, and model evaluation techniques.

## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Replace the placeholder URL in the `main()` function with the actual URL of the web page you want to scrape images from.

3. Replace the placeholder save directory in the `main()` function with the desired directory to save the scraped images.

4. Replace the placeholder model path in the `main()` function with the path to the trained model.

5. Run the program by executing the command `python main.py`.

## Example

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.xception import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

# ...
# The rest of the program code
# ...
```
